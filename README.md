# Take Notes with Funk

## Description

I was motivated to create this project to help myself and others stay organized in their daily lives. In Note-taker a user can write down ideas and thoughts they need to remember through out the day. I learned how to implement and use express to create API routes. I also learned how to deploy using Heroku.
